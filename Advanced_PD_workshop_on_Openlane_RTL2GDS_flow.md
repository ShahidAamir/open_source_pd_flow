# Advanced PD workshop on Openlane RTL2GDS flow

Reposotory documents the work done during the Advanced PD workshop using OpenLANE + SKY130 + PICORV32

## RTL2GDS
RTL to GDS flow refers to the process of systematically converting a Register Transfer Level (RTL) to a Graphic Design System (GDS)  II (2) stream format guided by a SynopsysÂ® Design Constraints (SDC) for Timing requirements and a Process Design Kit for Physical Layout constraints.

## DAY 1

### TOOL FLOW

### Directory Structure
<img src="images/PDK_DIR_LS.png">

#### Launching OpenLANE

##### Setting up a BASH Alias for launching OpenLANE Docker command
```bash
export PDK_ROOT=/home/kunalg123/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks
alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
```

##### Launching the OpenLANE docker container
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/
docker
```
This Launches a bash 4.2 prompt


##### OpenLANE flow can be run either fully autonomous or in an interactive mode
Launching OpenLANE Interactive flow
```bash
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
```
<img src="images/OPENLANE_LAUNCH.bmp">

##### Preparing the design
```bash
prep -design <design_name> -tag <current_run_tag> -overwrite
```
Tag the run using the tag argument and use overwrite argument if you want to clean the temporary and generated files
```bash
prep -design picorv32a -tag new_run_007 -overwrite
```
<img src="images/OPENLANE_PREP.bmp">

### RTL SYNTHESIS
OpenLANE uses YOSYS to convert the given verilog file to intermediary format used by ABC along with standard cell information to do standard cell mapping

```bash
run_synthesis
```

## DAY 2 

Every step in openlance can be configured via a set of passed arguments to the commands

<img src="images/FLOORPLAN_README.bmp">

### FLOORPLANNING
During Floorplan the core area is divided into rows of fixed size. This size is essentially the hieght of standard cells. Larger standard cells are expanded horizontally but the increment has to be kept a integer number of standard widths.
Next any cells that need to be preplaced, for example a Macro, are placed onto this grid. This step is called pre placement.
After preplacement decoupling capacitors for the preplaced cells are inserted, along with
Endcaps as well as TAP cell insertion takes place. IO pin placement is also decided at this stage.

Standard Cells are not placed during the Floorplanning stage.

##### Utilization and Aspect Ratio
At floorplanning stage Utilization factor is the ratio of Area consumed by the logic mapped to standard cells by ABC to the Total Core Area
Aspect Ratio is Ratio of Chip Hieght to Chip Width. This basically describes the chip geometry in a rough manner.
There both can be adjusted in the floorplan.tcl file

##### IO Placement
IO placement is an important step which deals with the distribution of IO Pins around the die, There are different strategies that can be explored by changing the arguments provided in the README file for OpenLANE flow.

##### Endcap and TAP cell insertion
Endcap cells are cells inserted at the Horizontal boundry of the the core for a variety of reasons, one of them being avoiding damage to standard cells at the boundarys. 
Tap cells are inserted to body bias the substrate to prevent leakage.

### OpenLANE: Running floorplan

### Viewing the Floorplan output in MAGIC
To view the floorplan in MAGIC we need to pass 3 files to it. We need the TECH file provided in the pdks, we need the merged LEF file generated post synthesis step
and the DEF file generated by the floorplan step.

```bash
magic -T ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/new_run_006/tmp/merged.lef def read ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/new_run_006/results/floorplan/picorv32a.floorplan.def
```

##### Selecting pins and using the what command
Zoom out and center on design -> press 'v' 
Selecting a pin -> hover cursor -> press 's'
Select an Area -> press LMB to select bottom left corner -> press RMB to select top right corner 
Zoom in to the selected area -> hold 'control' -> press 'z'

##### Inserted DECAP Cells

##### Inserted TAP CELLs 
<img src="images/TAPCELL_INSERTION.png">

##### Unplaced Standard CELLS
<img src="images/UNPLACED_STD_CELLS.png">

### Placement
Placement is the process or arranging the standard cells on the core using algorithms that optimise wirelength, congestion, etc.

##### OpenLANE: Placement
```bash
run_placement
```

##### Cell Design and Characterisation
A Standard Cell library contains many versions of a set of cells which do perform some boolean operation or provide storage.

Cell design flow basically takes as input the PDK, DRC, LVS, SPICE MODELS, LIBRARY AND USER DEFINED SPECS
Then the Circuit is designed, Layout is done and Characterisation takes place
The output of all these steps is a Circuit Description Language File.

GUNA is a tool which can be used to perform characterisation of Standard cells, IO pads, memories etc.

Timing characterisation includes extracting the cell output rise time, fall time, propagation delay, etc.

## DAY 3
### Cell design
pull the repository to obtain a inverter circuit layed out in magic and take a look at the files included
```git
git pull https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign
```
open the .mag file and take a look at the layed out inverter
you will need to provide the .TECH file an the .MAG file as arguments to the magic command.

<img src="INVERTER_LAYOUT.png">

##### DRC in MAGIC
DRC checks can be performed in magic using the following commands

```tk
drc count
drc why
drc find
```

drc count lists the count of DRC rules that have been violated, drc why explains the conflicting layer information and drc find lists the next error

##### Extraction of SPICE netlist from the Layout
To simulate and extract the timing characteristics from the cell we need to extract the spice netlist so that we can simulate it in ngspice.

Extract the netlist
```tk
extract all
```
Convert it to a spice deck
```tk
ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0
ext2spice
```
